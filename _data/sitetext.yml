    title: "Scarecrows in Oz: Large Language Models <br /> in Human-Robot Interaction"
    text: "
    In this workshop we want to explore the ways HRI researchers are using LLMs as \"Scarecrows\" -- components that (possibly brainlessly) approximate 
    pieces of desired functionality that are currently hard to achieve -- much as HRI researchers use Wizard of Oz in empirical experiments. And, just 
    as HRI researchers have historically discussed, the pros, cons, and need for reporting guidelines surrounding Wizard of Oz, we're equally 
    interested in this workshop in exploring the pros, cons, and need for reporting guidelines surrounding the uses of LLMs in HRI. <br /><br /> 
    
    We invite research regarding contributions, commentary, and questions about (and combinations of) the following topics of interest: 


    * the impact of \"stubbing out\" software modules as \"Scarecrows\" (traditionally done with humans in Wizard-of-Oz contexts) by using LLMs when building and testing larger HRI experiments;\n    
    * opportunities and applications of LLMs in HRI;\n
    * risks and perils of LLMs in interactive robots;\n
    * reporting guidelines, ethical considerations, or real-world implications of LLMs in HRI;\n
    * safety of LLM-driven interaction, and fine-tuned LLMs during interactions with the world or users; and/or\n
    * position or framing papers on the role of LLMs in HRI."
