We invite research regarding contributions, commentary, and questions about (and combinations of) the following topics of interest:

* the impact of “stubbing out” software modules as “Scarecrows” (traditionally done with humans in Wizard-of-Oz contexts) by using LLMs when building and testing larger HRI experiments;
* opportunities and applications of LLMs in HRI;
* risks and perils of LLMs in interactive robots;
* reporting guidelines, ethical considerations, or real-world implications of LLMs in HRI;
* safety of LLM-driven interaction, and fine-tuned LLMs during interactions with the world or users; and/or
* position or framing papers on the role of LLMs in HRI.
